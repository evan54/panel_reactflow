# panel_reactflow

Goal is to allow modification and bidirectional communication of a graph like structure. JS library ported is http://www.reactflow.dev/

Idea was to be similar to streamlit's cytoscape (https://github.com/vivien000/st-cytoscape).

Other very interesting project along these lines is https://github.com/Zelfior/reactflow_component/blob/master/reactflow.py but this seems to be mostly around a computation enginge.
